I opened the meeting by describing how our simulator, even though it is a purely numerical tool, encourages scenarios where more acoustic impulses are put into the water. By helping users tune sources for clearer detections, we may indirectly normalize higher source levels or more frequent pings, which intensifies masking, stress responses, and habitat displacement for marine mammals, fish, and invertebrates. I also flagged that our simplified 2D physics and homogeneous sound-speed assumptions could cause us to under-predict the real exposure in complex environments, so we have to be vocal that the model is only an exploratory aid and not a guarantee of ecological safety.

Manuel focused on how underwater noise decisions ripple through coastal, Indigenous, and small-scale fishing communities who rarely have the money or expertise to run proprietary propagation models. He emphasized that our open-source approach could strengthen these stakeholders if we pair it with clear documentation, but that the same asymmetry leaves them vulnerable when industry actors wield sophisticated tools to justify projects. His point was that ethical responsibility extends beyond wildlife to procedural fairness—ensuring communities can contest or validate the analyses that affect their livelihoods.

Camille concluded the discussion by examining dual-use risks and the irony that research-driven monitoring can create new noise. She noted that releasing an accessible, well-documented simulator benefits conservation but also lowers the barrier for defense organizations to optimize sonar or surveillance systems, with little reciprocal sharing from classified domains. She also reminded us that the field trials and validation campaigns our future users perform contribute additional vessel and sonar noise, so any mitigation plan should weigh the environmental cost of data collection itself.
