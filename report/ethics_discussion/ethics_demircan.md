# Internal Team Meeting

**Date:** 2026-11-30, 12:00 PM
**Location:** Building 32 - Stata Center
**Attendees:** Camille Wardlaw, Manuel Valencia, Demircan Tas

I argued that building a simulation tool may have a future increase in underwater noise levels by increasing research activity. Our tool may inadvertantly enable higher acoustic levels at specific frequencies by tuning out more visible ones. Adverse impacts on underwater wildlife that are hard to detect initially may increase. I also emphasized that the limitations of our model, if not clearly acknowledged, may lead to under-predicting exposure in physical, complex environments.

Manuel stated that multiple communities are exposed by the effects of underwater noise levels. Proprietary tools and models may lead to lack of access by some communities while enabling others. Corporate actors may use their access to software resources to benefit from an assymettry when justifying decisions that serve their benefit. Open-sourcing our tools may be a potent solution.

Camille pointed out that proprietary software for research may create tensions among research bodies and the military. Military research is often opaque, providing impunity against the negative effects of research on the nature and vulnureable communities. She also argued that open sourcing our work would mitigate the aforementioned tension.
