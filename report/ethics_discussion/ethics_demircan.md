# Ethical evaluation of our project

We propose a simulation tool for emulating acoustic impulses under water. Our tool can have unintended impacts on wildlife via increased underwater noise that may stem from the use of our simulator.

- Increased acoustic impulses overall
- Biological impacts

## Dual use and misuse of our simulator
- Military/surveillance uses
- Greenwashing by modeling
- Other incentives misaligned with ethics

## Limitations of our system
- We conduct our simulations under strict assumptions that will fall short of predicting unforeseen physical phenomena. Ignoring the limitations may lead to impacts we do not intend.
- Spatial and distributional effects
