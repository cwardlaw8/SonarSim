During our ethics discussion, each team member emphasized a different area of potential harm. Demirican Tas focused on wildlife impacts, noting that underwater noise modeling directly intersects with marine mammal disturbance, habitat degradation, and uncertainties in how simplified models might underpredict ecological risk. I centered the conversation on community-level impacts, especially how coastal, Indigenous, and small-scale fishing communities often bear the consequences of underwater noise, yet lack access to high-quality modeling tools to challenge industry assessments. Camille raised the issue of defense applications and dual-use risks, highlighting how even benign acoustic simulators can be appropriated to optimize military sonar performance or justify deployments that intensify noise pollution.

A major theme that emerged across our perspectives was distributional fairness—specifically, who has the capability to use acoustic modeling to advocate for their interests. Those with more power and resources typically have access to proprietary models, computational resources, and expert consultants, whereas disadvantaged communities rarely do. This asymmetry can unintentionally reinforce existing power imbalances with lack of access leaving certain groups unable to meaningfully participate in environmental review or regulatory debates. Fairness concerns relate not only to the biological effects but to structural inequities in who can model, evaluate, and contest underwater noise impacts.

To address these issues, we identified open-source availability, transparent documentation, and explicit limitation statements as key mitigation strategies. Making our simulator openly accessible lowers the barrier for communities, educators, and smaller organizations to engage with acoustic impact assessments. Clear documentation—especially around assumptions, appropriate use cases, and known failure modes—helps prevent overreliance or misuse, including defense-sector optimization. Finally, framing the tool as an educational and exploratory simulator, rather than a regulatory-grade model, ensures that users understand its appropriate scope. Collectively, these measures support more equitable access while reducing the risk of harmful or unintended applications.
